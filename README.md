# Task Manager

##Motivation

This project was part of my time with the Flatiron Program, where I was tasked with utilizing Ruby on Rails to create an application with three different models in an MVC framework. I wanted to emulate something with real business value, so I made this app with a team project in mind.

##Tech/Framework

This project runs on Ruby 2.6 and utilizes Rails 6.0

##Installation

After cloning the repository, simply run bundle install (presuming you have the prequisites installed) and run "rails s" to access in your browsers.
