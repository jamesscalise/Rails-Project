# Task Manager

##Motivation

This project was part of my time with the Flatiron Program, where I was tasked with utilizing Ruby on Rails to create an application with three different models in an MVC framework. I wanted to emulate something with real business value, so I made this app with a team project in mind.

##Tech/Framework

This project runs on Ruby 2.6 and utilizes Rails 6.0

##Installation

After cloning the repository, simply run bundle install (presuming you have the prequisites installed) and run "rails s" to access in your browsers.

##How To Use

Accessing the live application [here](https://blooming-ridge-40522.herokuapp.com/)

Create an account either utilizing the login screen or through OAuth with your Facebook account. You can select to be a manager, which gives you more options for accessing lists and tasks.

As a manager, you are able to create lists, create and assign tasks, and check off tasks for any user. As a non-manager you are able to check out tasks that are assigned to you. Both types of users are able to view any list, user page, or task.

When finished you have the option of logging out and signing back in later.
